Abstract files provided to get a grasp of my project about. 

There are 2 types of datasets used for this project UTDMHAD and Smartwatch.
Classification UTMHAD and Smartwatch are files that classification process using 3 different machine learning algorithm performed on Jupyter Notebook. 
The machine learning algorithms uses are 
  1. Decision Tree
  2. Linear Support Vector Machine
  3. K-Nearest Neighbors.
 
All the other files are data processing files which the datasets are processed from raw until feature extraction before used in classification process.
